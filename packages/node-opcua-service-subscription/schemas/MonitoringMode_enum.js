// OPCUA Spec 1.02 Part 4 page 5.12.1.3 Monitoring Mode:
// The monitoring mode parameter is used to enable and disable the sampling of a MonitoredItem, and also to provide
// for independently enabling and disabling the reporting of Notifications. This capability allows a MonitoredItem to
// be configured to sample, sample and report, or neither. Disabling sampling does not change the values of any of the
// other MonitoredItem parameter, such as its sampling interval.
// When a MonitoredItem is enabled (i.e. when the MonitoringMode is changed from DISABLED to SAMPLING or REPORTING)
// or it is created in the enabled state, the Server shall report the first sample as soon as possible and the time
// of this sample becomes the starting point for the next sampling interval.
