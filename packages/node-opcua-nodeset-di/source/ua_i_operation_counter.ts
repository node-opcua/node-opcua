     * not include pure Wake on LAN. This value shall
     * only increase during the lifetime of the Device
     * and shall not be reset when the Device is
     * restarted. The PowerOnDuration is provided as
     * Duration, i.e., in milliseconds or even fractions
     * of a millisecond. However, the Server is not
     * expected to update the value in such a high
     * frequency, but maybe once a minute or once an
