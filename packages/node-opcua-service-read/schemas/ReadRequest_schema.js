/*
 * Maximum age of the value to be read in milliseconds. The age of the value is based on the difference between the
 * ServerTimestamp and the time when the Server starts processing the request. For example if the Client specifies a
 * maxAge of 500 milliseconds and it takes 100 milliseconds until the Server starts processing the request, the age of
 * the returned value could be 600 milliseconds prior to the time it was requested.
 * If the Server has one or more values of an Attribute that are within the maximum age, it can return any one of the
 * values or it can read a new value from the data source. The number of values of an Attribute that a Server has
 * depends on the number of MonitoredItems that are defined for the Attribute.
 * In any case, the Client can make no assumption about which copy of the data will be returned.
 * If the Server does not have a value that is within the maximum age, it shall attempt to read a new value from the
 * data source.
 * If the Server cannot meet the requested maxAge, it returns its “best effort” value rather than rejecting the request.
 * This may occur when the time it takes the Server to process and return the new data value after it has been accessed
 * is greater than the specified maximum age.
 * If maxAge is set to 0, the Server shall attempt to read a new value from the data source.
 * If maxAge is set to the max Int32 value or greater, the Server shall attempt to get a cached value.
 * Negative values are invalid for maxAge.
