     * information to these codes. A Server which supports no quality information shall return Good.
     * This quality can also reflect the communication status associated with the system that this

     * errors to the underlying system, especially those that result in some unavailable Event fields,

     * is from an underlining system and no direct mapping to a variable is available, it is up to the

     * The Severity of a Condition is inherited from the base Event model defined in Part 5. It
     * indicates the urgency of the Condition and is also commonly called ‘priority’, especially in
     * relation to Alarms in the ProcessConditionClass.
     *
     * as per spec 1.0.3 - PArt 5
     * Severity is an indication of the urgency of the Event. This is also commonly called “priority”.
     * Values will range from 1 to 1 000, with 1 being the lowest severity and 1 000 being the highest.
     * Typically, a severity of 1 would indicate an Event which is informational in nature, while a value
     * of 1 000 would indicate an Event of catastrophic nature, which could potentially result in severe
     * financial loss or loss of life.
     * It is expected that very few Server implementations will support 1 000 distinct severity levels.
     * Therefore, Server developers are responsible for distributing their severity levels across the
     * 1 to 1 000 range in such a manner that clients can assume a linear distribution. For example, a
     * client wishing to present five severity levels to a user should be able to do the following
     * mapping:
     *            Client Severity OPC Severity
     *                HIGH        801 – 1 000
     *                MEDIUM HIGH 601 – 800
     *                MEDIUM      401 – 600
     *                MEDIUM LOW  201 – 400
     *                LOW           1 – 200
     * In many cases a strict linear mapping of underlying source severities to the OPC Severity range
     * is not appropriate. The Server developer will instead intelligently map the underlying source
     * severities to the 1 to 1 000 OPC Severity range in some other fashion. In particular, it is
     * recommended that Server developers map Events of high urgency into the OPC severity range
     * of 667 to 1 000, Events of medium urgency into the OPC severity range of 334 to 666 and
     * Events of low urgency into OPC severities of 1 to 333.
