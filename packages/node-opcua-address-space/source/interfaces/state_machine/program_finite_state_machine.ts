/**
 * Program Finite State Machine
 *
 *
 * as per part 10 : Program Specification
 *
 * A standard set of base states is defined for Programs as part of the Program Finite State
 * Machine. These states represent the stages in which a Program can exist at an instance in
 * time as viewed by a Client. This state is the Program’s current state. All Programs shall
 * support this base set. A Program may or may not require a Client action to cause the state to
 * change. The states are formally defined in Table 2.
 *
 *
 * Table 2 – Program states
 *  | State     | Description
 *  |-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 *  | Ready     | The Program is properly initialized and may be started.                             |
 *  | Running   | The Program is executing making progress towards completion.                        |
 *  | Suspended | The Program has been stopped prior to reaching a terminal state but may be resumed. |
 *  | Halted    | The Program is in a terminal or failed state, and it cannot be started or resumed without being reset|
 *
 *  The set of states defined to describe a Program can be expanded. Program sub states can be
 *  defined for the base states to provide more resolution of a process and to describe the cause
 *  and effect(s) of additional stimuli and transitions.
 *  Standards bodies and industry groups may extend the base Program Finite State Model to conform to
 *  various industry models. For example, the Halted state can include the sub states “Aborted” and “Completed”
 *  to indicate if the function achieved a successful conclusion prior to the transition to Halted.
