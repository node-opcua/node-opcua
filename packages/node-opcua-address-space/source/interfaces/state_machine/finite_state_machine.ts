/**
 * Finite State Machine
 *
 * The FiniteStateMachineType is the base ObjectType for StateMachines that explicitly define
 * the possible States and Transitions. Once the States are defined subtypes shall not add new
 * States (see B.4.18).
 * The States of the machine are represented with instances of the StateType ObjectType.
 *
 * EachState shall have a BrowseName which is unique within the StateMachine and shall have a
 * StateNumber which shall also be unique across all States defined in the StateMachine.
 *
 * Be aware that States in a SubStateMachine may have the same StateNumber or BrowseName as
 * States in the parent machine. A concrete subtype of FiniteStateMachineType shall define at
 * least one State.
 *
 * A StateMachine may define one State which is an instance of the InitialStateType. This State
 * is the State that the machine goes into when it is activated.
 *
 * The Transitions that may occur are represented with instances of the TransitionType.
 *
 * Each Transition shall have a BrowseName which is unique within the StateMachine and may have a
 * TransitionNumber which shall also be unique across all Transitions defined in the StateMachine.
 *
 * The initial State for a Transition is a StateType Object which is the target of a FromState
 * Reference. The final State for a Transition is a StateType Object which is the target of a ToState
 * Reference. The FromState and ToState References shall always be specified.
 * A Transition may produce an Event. The Event is indicated by a HasEffect Reference to a
 * subtype of BaseEventType. The StateMachineType shall have GeneratesEvent References to
 * the targets of a HasEffect Reference for each of its Transitions.
 * A FiniteStateMachineType may define Methods that cause a transition to occur. These Methods
 * are targets of HasCause References for each of the Transitions that may be triggered by the
 * Method. The Executable Attribute for a Method is used to indicate whether the current State of
 * the machine allows the Method to be called.
 *
 * A FiniteStateMachineType may have sub-state-machines which are represented as instances
 * of StateMachineType ObjectTypes. Each State shall have a HasSubStateMachine Reference
 * to the StateMachineType Object which represents the child States. The SubStateMachine is
 * not active if the parent State is not active. In this case the CurrentState and LastTransition
 * Variables of the SubStateMachine shall have a status equal to BadStateNotActive (see Table
 * B.17).
